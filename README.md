# Alphabet Soup Charity Deep Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code for building a binary classification model to predict the success of funding applications for the Alphabet Soup charity. Using a dataset of past funding requests, a neural network model was developed to determine whether or not the money provided to applicants was effectively utilized.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing including encoding of categorical variables and scaling of features.
- Construction of a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluation of model performance through accuracy and loss metrics.
- Exporting of the trained model for future predictions.

## Usage

To run the deep learning model, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The `charity_data.csv` file is loaded, and the features are preprocessed, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric data.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow and trained with the preprocessed data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated for accuracy and loss on the test dataset.

4. **Model Export**:
   - The trained model is exported to an HDF5 file (`AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`) for future use.

You can customize the neural network architecture and hyperparameters to further optimize the model performance.

## Model Optimization

### Key Approaches:
- Multiple attempts were made to optimize the model by adjusting the number of hidden layers and neurons, tweaking activation functions, and tuning the learning rate. 

### Optimization Methods:
- Added hidden layers and adjusted the number of neurons in each.
- Experimented with different activation functions such as `relu` and `tanh`.
- Increased the number of training epochs for better model convergence.
- Applied early stopping and dropout to reduce overfitting.
